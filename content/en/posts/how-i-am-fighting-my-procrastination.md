As a good procrastinator, I've read about procrastination a lot. And if you're reading this, I bet you have too. We all tried to stop procrastinating by Just Getting Started, trying the Pomodoro technique, structuring procrastination, etc. Maybe these things worked for you, but they definitely didn't for me. I always found a way out from the task at hand distracted by something else or was unable to concentrate at all.

What is working for me, though, is getting to know myself. I know it sounds cliché, but it was only when I shifted my focus from applying some tricks to beat procrastination to actually trying to understand why I was procrastinating in the first place that I started to get some results. I've came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of these tricks is entirely personal, and the only way to know is trying and —most importantly— adjusting them yourself.

That said, I still find it valuable to read what others are doing to stop procrastination so I can try them myself and evaluate if they personally help me, since it's a constant battle I fight every single day. In this article I'll share what I'm doing about procrastination and productivity that have been working for me lately, organized by the material that influenced me the most.

## Let your mind clear












## Learning How to Learn

Learning How to Learn is the most popular MOOC on Coursera that teaches some techniques for learning, like recalling, deliberate practice, spaced repetition, etc. It also provides some tricks to prevent procrastination (Just Get Started and the Pomodoro technique), but it's not their focus. 

What made the most impact for me was discovering how our memory works. We have two memory systems, a working memory and a long term memory (think RAM and HDD). All good, except that our working memory kind of sucks: it can only hold 4 chunks of information simultaneously.

This gave me an insight


## Deep Work

My anti-procrastination journey started with the so recommended book Deep Work, by Cal Newport. This book essentially made me understand that we should prioritize focused work to be productive (learn complex things and produce at an elite level). There is one main problem that we have to tackle here though: **distractions**. 

When I tried to sit down and batch my work into long, uninterrupted chunks of time, I felt exaclty the pain mentioned 



In this post I'll briefly share what I believe about procrastination and productivity and what I'm doing that have been working for me lately.
