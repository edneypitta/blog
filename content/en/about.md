Hi! I'm Edney Pitta, a full stack web developer with 6 years of experience.
I work in Oporto at Farfetch building distributed applications with .NET Core.

I like to solve problems and create value with software. I'm always looking for more effective ways of doing it, be it choosing the right tool for the job or finding a better solution to a business problem.
